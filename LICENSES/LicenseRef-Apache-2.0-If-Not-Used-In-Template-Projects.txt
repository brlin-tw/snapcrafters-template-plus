using it in the making of another template project.  This allows
re-licensing the project assets to your liking in your non-template
projects with only a legal conformance requirement of attributing this
product somewhere in your project/product credits/acknowledgment/copyright

Note that some assets that are not declared using this pseudo license
may also allow re-licensing as the declared license does not impose such
restrictions in the first place, refer the individual license terms for
details.
