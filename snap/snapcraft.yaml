description: |
  This is my-awesome-app's description. You have a paragraph or two to tell
  the most important story about your snap. Keep it under 100 words though,
  we live in tweetspace and your description wants to look good in the snap
  store.

  This is the demonstration app of the Snapcrafters Template Plus:
